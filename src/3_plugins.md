# Plugins
*this section is a work in progress*

Plugins are the core feature of asterai.
A plugin is a WebAssembly module, which can be written in
[AssemblyScript][asc], a TypeScript-like language.

Plugins have access to a range of functionality such as LLMs and Vector DBs.
They can also make HTTP calls and establish and manage WebSocket connections.

Therefore, a plugin can act as an integral bridge, connecting AI to
applications.
