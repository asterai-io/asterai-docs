# Cloud Console & CLI
*this section is a work in progress*

The cloud console can be accessed from the asterai website.
It lets you create and manage applications.

The CLI tool, which can be installed on your computer via NPM, is used to
deploy plugins into your applications.

Once a plugin has been added to an application, you can access the cloud
console from asterai's website and turn that plugin on or off, or delete the
plugin.
Other features, such as Vector DBs, can also be managed from the cloud console.
